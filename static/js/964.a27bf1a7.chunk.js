I am sophomore computer science major, working on a minor in political science.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt UMass, I am spending my time learning new programming languages and how to apply them to my future. I have also been given the opportunity as a part of the ERSP program to develop a research project related to data visualization under the supervision of [Dr. Cindy Xiong](https://cyxiong.com/), and the [HCI-Vis Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hci-vis/).\n\n# Some history\n\n- At 8, I took an afterschool typing course where we also played the [Logical Journey of the Zoombinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Journey_of_the_Zoombinis). I then realized that I loved problem solving, which then lead me to spend an entire summer obsessed with sudoku.\n\n- When I was 10, my dad created Instagram accounts for my brothers and I as a way to connect with our long distance family. I developed a love for photography and using images to capture my favorite memories.\n\n- At 11, my school held a workshop where we brought in broken electronics to disassemble in preparation for the CT Invention Convention. What did I learn? I'm still not sure.\n\n- At 15, I took my first computer science course. It was AP Computer Science Principles, taught using MIT App Inventor, that started me down the road of spending long nights debugging on VS Code.\n\n- 16 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Skyrim, Sims 4, and Civilization.\n\n- During the height of the pandemic in 2020 I connected with my pen pal in Amsterdam. We still send each other letters to this day.\n\n- Currently at 19, I am still exploring my love of programming, and trying to stay up to date on my numerous random hobbies such as sewing, crocheting and beading.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Skiing\n- Soccer\n- Sewing\n- <p style=\"color:#CCCCFF\">The color perwinkle</p>\n- Autumn\n- [Books](https://instagram.com/wren.aesthetic)\n\n- [Good design](/)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have never flown outside of the United States (but I will this fall when I study abroad in Denmark!)\n- I am a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki, especially [Spirited Away](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/),[Howls Moving Castle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/), and [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097814/)\n- I am a Dunkin fan over Starbucks\n- My mom is a Giants fan and my dad is a Cowboys fan, which makes Monday Night Football very chaotic\n- I love jigsaw puzzles and just finished [The Two Million Dollar Puzzle](https://twomillionpuzzle.com/), (we won one dollar)\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better.\n- truly living, not just surviving.\n\n",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(n){return n.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(n){return n.length})).length,c=function(n){var e=Object.assign({},n);return(0,l.jsx)(o.rU,(0,i.Z)({},e))};e.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(r.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Erin Melia",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(o.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(s(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
